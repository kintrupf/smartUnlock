SmartUnlock
===========
SmartUnlock is a set of scripts (aka flows), that run in Automagic Premium on Android phones.
They enable you to keep your phone unlocked as long as possible when it is safe to do so.
So in many cases you don't need to enter your PIN code when switching the display on.
"Safe" in this context means the phone is in a "trusted" context like connected to a certain WLAN or Bluetooth device or within a defined location.

Pre-requisites

    An Android phone
    Automagic Premium
